# **Fish Species Predictor - Deployed on Heroku** 

This project is a **machine learning-based fish species classification model**, trained on the **Fish Market dataset**. The model predicts the species of a fish based on its physical attributes. The entire application is deployed on **Heroku**, allowing users to make predictions via a web interface.

---

## Project Overview
- **Problem Statement**: Given fish measurement data (Weight, Length, Height, Width), predict the species of the fish.
- **Model Type**: **Classification** (Multi-class prediction of fish species).
- **Machine Learning Algorithm**: `RandomForestClassifier`
- **Frontend**: HTML + CSS + JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask API (Python)
- **Deployment Platform**: Heroku  
- **Live App URL**: [Currently unavailable (link)](https://fish-predictor-2025-65a68cbab75e.herokuapp.com/)  
  *Note: The app is currently inactive as Heroku has discontinued its free tier. Please contact me if you'd like a live demo or deployment support.*

## How It Works
### 1 Model Training
- The model was trained using the **Fish Market dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/fish-market).
- Features: `Weight`, `Length1`, `Length2`, `Length3`, `Height`, `Width`
- The data was **standardized** using `StandardScaler()`, and labels were **encoded** using `LabelEncoder()`.
- A `RandomForestClassifier` was trained and saved as `fish_species_classifier.pkl`.

### 2 Flask API
- The Flask app (`app.py`) loads the trained model and exposes a **REST API**.
- It receives input data from the **frontend form** and returns a **predicted fish species**.

### 3 Frontend (User Interface)
- Users enter **fish measurements** in a simple web form (`index.html`).
- The form sends data to the Flask backend, which returns a prediction.

### 4 Deployment on Heroku
- The app was containerized and deployed on **Heroku**.
- Used `gunicorn` as the WSGI server.
- `Procfile` specifies the entry point for Heroku:
  ```
  web: gunicorn app:app
  ```
